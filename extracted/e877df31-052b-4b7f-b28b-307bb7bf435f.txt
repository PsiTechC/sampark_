SCOPE OF WORK FOR 
HIRING OF SERVICES FOR APPLICATION MIGRATION TO PRIVATE CLOUD 
This  scope  of  work  outlines  a  plan  for  the  migration,  highlighting  the  processes, 
phases, and information requirements essential for a seamless, secure, and optimized 
transition.  
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this migration are: 
1. Transition of local applications  to  the private  cloud  while  preserving  functionality 
and data integrity. 
2. Optimize  application  performance,  scalability,  and  security  within  the  cloud 
infrastructure. 
3. To establish API calls between application and distributed storage which is secure 
and role based.  
Migration Plan 
Phase 1: Infrastructure and Environment Setup 
1. Configuration of Private Cloud 
 Securely  configure  the microstack  based private  cloud  with  necessary 
resources and network settings to ensure seamless integration. 
2. Staging Environment Creation 
 Establish a staging environment within the private cloud test bed to test 
applications pre-deployment. 
 Implement  monitoring  tools  to  ensure  system  performance  is  actively 
observed during migration. 
3. Additional Security Configurations 
 Validate any specific requirements, such as two-factor authentication or 
unique access methods, for cloud resources based on protocols including SSL, 
LDAP integration etc. 
Phase 2: Data Migration 
1. Data Backup and Integrity 
 Full back up of all databases, files, and configurations from the current 
environment, verified against preferred methods. 
2. Database and File Transfer/ Migration 
 Securely transfer/ migration databases and media files to the cloud using 
approved transfer protocols. 
 Validate   database   integrity   post-transfer   in   alignment   with   cloud 
configurations. 
3. Client Data Migration Preferences 

 Any preferred tools or protocols, as suggested by buyer, for secure and 
efficient data transfer will be considered and implemented. 
Phase 3: Application Code and Configuration Migration 
1. Deployment of Application Code 
 Upload  and  configure  application  code  in  the  cloud  environment, 
replicating all dependencies as per the existing configuration after successful 
VA/PT  of  the  application. Clearance of VA/PT  will  be bidder’s responsibility. 
VA/PT will be undertaken by buyer nominated agency.  
2. Configuration Updates 
 Adjustments  to  environment  variables,  API  keys,  and  paths  to  ensure 
compatibility with the cloud environment. 
 Writing of API’s to ensure secure integration of application to HDFS/ or 
equivalent storage for data read & write 
3. Containerization  
 containerizing  applications  (e.g.,  with  Docker)  for  enhanced  portability 
and scalability. 
Phase 4: Testing and Validation 
1. Functional Testing 
 Verify application functionality comprehensively in the new environment, 
ensuring all front-end and back-end components perform as expected. 
2. Performance and Load Testing 
 Conduct performance tests to identify and rectify any potential issues or 
bottlenecks, with a focus on scalability. 
3. Compliance and Security Validation 
 Conduct  a  security  audit,  ensuring  alignment  security and  compliance 
requirements, including encrypted data transfer and secure access. 
4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) 
 test the application in the staging environment to verify functionality, 
performance, and security standards. 
Phase 5: Final Deployment and DNS Configuration 
1. Go-Live Scheduling and Cutover Strategy 
2. DNS and Network Setup 
 Update DNS configurations to direct domain to the cloud server. 
 Install SSL/TLS certificates as required for secure HTTPS connections. 
3. Final Testing and Monitoring 

 Post-launch testing  to  confirm  that  all  functionalities  are  operating  as 
expected. 
 Close monitoring of the application to identify and resolve any immediate 
post-migration issues. 
Phase 6: Post-Migration Support and Optimization 
1. Performance Monitoring and Alerting 
 Establish  performance  monitoring  with  automated  alerts  for  resource 
usage, downtime, or unusual traffic, ensuring optimal operation. 
2. Backup and Disaster Recovery Setup 
 Design and implement a regular backup schedule, based on preferred 
schedule, along with validated recovery processes. 
3. Documentation and Handover 
 Comprehensive documentation of the new architecture and processes 
for future reference and internal training. 
Note:- Any  standard  application  will  have  to  be  connected  to  web  based 
application  and  will  have  to  be  made  cloud  compatible  (dockerised etc)  by 
bidder.
