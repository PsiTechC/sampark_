SCOPE OF WORK FOR 
HIRING OF SERVICES FOR APPLICATION MIGRATION TO PRIVATE CLOUD 
This  scope  of  work  outlines  a  plan  for  the  migration,  highlighting  the  processes, 
phases, and information requirements essential for a seamless, secure, and optimized 
transition.  
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this migration are: 
1. Transition of local applications  to  the private  cloud  while  preserving  functionality 
and data integrity. 
2. Optimize  application  performance,  scalability,  and  security  within  the  cloud 
infrastructure. 
3. To establish API calls between application and distributed storage which is secure 
and role based.  
Migration Plan 
Phase 1: Infrastructure and Environment Setup 
1. Configuration of Private Cloud 
 Securely  configure  the microstack  based private  cloud  with  necessary 
resources and network settings to ensure seamless integration. 
2. Staging Environment Creation 
 Establish a staging environment within the private cloud test bed to test 
applications pre-deployment. 
 Implement  monitoring  tools  to  ensure  system  performance  is  actively 
observed during migration. 
3. Additional Security Configurations 
 Validate any specific requirements, such as two-factor authentication or 
unique access methods, for cloud resources based on protocols including SSL, 
LDAP integration etc. 
Phase 2: Data Migration 
1. Data Backup and Integrity 
 Full back up of all databases, files, and configurations from the current 
environment, verified against preferred methods. 
2. Database and File Transfer/ Migration 
 Securely transfer/ migration databases and media files to the cloud using 
approved transfer protocols. 
 Validate   database   integrity   post-transfer   in   alignment   with   cloud 
configurations. 
3. Client Data Migration Preferences 

 Any preferred tools or protocols, as suggested by buyer, for secure and 
efficient data transfer will be considered and implemented. 
Phase 3: Application Code and Configuration Migration 
1. Deployment of Application Code 
 Upload  and  configure  application  code  in  the  cloud  environment, 
replicating all dependencies as per the existing configuration after successful 
VA/PT  of  the  application. Clearance of VA/PT  will  be bidder’s responsibility. 
VA/PT will be undertaken by buyer nominated agency.  
2. Configuration Updates 
 Adjustments  to  environment  variables,  API  keys,  and  paths  to  ensure 
compatibility with the cloud environment. 
 Writing of API’s to ensure secure integration of application to HDFS/ or 
equivalent storage for data read & write 
3. Containerization  
 containerizing  applications  (e.g.,  with  Docker)  for  enhanced  portability 
and scalability. 
Phase 4: Testing and Validation 
1. Functional Testing 
 Verify application functionality comprehensively in the new environment, 
ensuring all front-end and back-end components perform as expected. 
2. Performance and Load Testing 
 Conduct performance tests to identify and rectify any potential issues or 
bottlenecks, with a focus on scalability. 
3. Compliance and Security Validation 
 Conduct  a  security  audit,  ensuring  alignment  security and  compliance 
requirements, including encrypted data transfer and secure access. 
4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) 
 test the application in the staging environment to verify functionality, 
performance, and security standards. 
Phase 5: Final Deployment and DNS Configuration 
1. Go-Live Scheduling and Cutover Strategy 
2. DNS and Network Setup 
 Update DNS configurations to direct domain to the cloud server. 
 Install SSL/TLS certificates as required for secure HTTPS connections. 
3. Final Testing and Monitoring 

 Post-launch testing  to  confirm  that  all  functionalities  are  operating  as 
expected. 
 Close monitoring of the application to identify and resolve any immediate 
post-migration issues. 
Phase 6: Post-Migration Support and Optimization 
1. Performance Monitoring and Alerting 
 Establish  performance  monitoring  with  automated  alerts  for  resource 
usage, downtime, or unusual traffic, ensuring optimal operation. 
2. Backup and Disaster Recovery Setup 
 Design and implement a regular backup schedule, based on preferred 
schedule, along with validated recovery processes. 
3. Documentation and Handover 
 Comprehensive documentation of the new architecture and processes 
for future reference and internal training. 
Note:- Any  standard  application  will  have  to  be  connected  to  web  based 
application  and  will  have  to  be  made  cloud  compatible  (dockerised etc)  by 
bidder. 
  

SCOPE OF WORK FOR HIRING OF SERVICES FOR DESIGN AND 
DEPLOYMENT OF A SOLUTION FOR POWER BI INCLUDING  
DEVELOPMENT OF MAP BASED REPORTS  
 
1. The Weapons & Electronics Systems Engineering Establishment (WESEE), 
under Ministry of Defence, Government of India, intends to obtain Hiring of services 
for Design and Deployment of a solution for Power BI including development of map 
based reports. 
 
Introduction 
 
2. Indian Navy is in the process of setting up an interactive and user-friendly map-
based  dashboard  in  Power  BI  that  provides  insights  into  key  business  metrics, 
enabling data-driven decision-making. 
 
3. The scope of work will consist of comprehensive plan for the Hiring of services 
for Design and Deployment of a solution for Power BI including development of map 
based reports, specifically focused on creating a map-based dashboard and related 
reports. The goal is to provide organisational needs that meets the actionable insights 
through visual data representation in following requirement:- 
 
(a) Deployment of SQL Server / Enterprise level Power BI in on premise 
cloud with offline map integration. 
(b) Web based 
(c) Dashboard  development  as  per  user  requirement (integrated  with 
multiple database/data sources) 
(d) Source code and all configuration file will be handed over to IN. 
 
4. Developed  solution  would  be  (able  to)  and  used  for analysing  data  being 
generated from various platforms and sources in an on premise private cloud. Some 
features to be developed are as follows: - 
 
(a) Data Visualization.    Creating  intuitive  and  interactive  visualizations. 
This is crucial for naval operations where complex data sets from sensors (e.g., 
sonar, radar etc.) need to be interpreted quickly and effectively. 
(b) Real-Time Analytics. With sensor data being collected 
continuously, tool  to provide  real-time  analytics  and  dashboards.  This  allows 
naval   operators   to   make   timely   decisions   based   on   the   most   current 
information. 
(c) Integration Capabilities. Integrate    with    various    data    sources, 
including databases, Excel files, and cloud services. This is particularly useful 
for  combining  historical  data  with  real-time  sensor  data  for  comprehensive 
analysis. 
(d) Customizable Reports. Create tailored reports that focus on specific 
metrics    relevant    to    naval    operations, such    as    vessel   performance, 
environmental  conditions,  or  mission  readiness. (to  be  developed  in  dash 
board) 

(e) Enhanced Collaboration. Sharing of insights and reports across teams 
while maintaining control over data access in a private cloud environment. 
(f) Predictive Analytics. Should support advanced analytics, enabling 
predictive modeling to forecast trends or mission outcomes based on historical 
data. 
(g) User-Friendly Interface. The  tool's  ease  of  use  allows  personnel, 
regardless  of  technical  expertise,  to engage with  the  data, facilitating  a  data-
driven culture within the naval organization. 
(h) Scalability. As  data  volume  grows, tool  should scale  accordingly, 
accommodating additional  sensor  data  and  more  complex  analyses  without 
compromising performance. 
5. Further,  it  is  imperative  that  the selected software and design tool shouldn’t 
have any requirement to be connected to internet for any update or feature.
