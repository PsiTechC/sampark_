SCOPE OF WORK FOR HIRING OF SERVICES FOR DESIGN AND 
DEPLOYMENT OF A SOLUTION FOR POWER BI INCLUDING  
DEVELOPMENT OF MAP BASED REPORTS  
 
1. The Weapons & Electronics Systems Engineering Establishment (WESEE), 
under Ministry of Defence, Government of India, intends to obtain Hiring of services 
for Design and Deployment of a solution for Power BI including development of map 
based reports. 
 
Introduction 
 
2. Indian Navy is in the process of setting up an interactive and user-friendly map-
based  dashboard  in  Power  BI  that  provides  insights  into  key  business  metrics, 
enabling data-driven decision-making. 
 
3. The scope of work will consist of comprehensive plan for the Hiring of services 
for Design and Deployment of a solution for Power BI including development of map 
based reports, specifically focused on creating a map-based dashboard and related 
reports. The goal is to provide organisational needs that meets the actionable insights 
through visual data representation in following requirement:- 
 
(a) Deployment of SQL Server / Enterprise level Power BI in on premise 
cloud with offline map integration. 
(b) Web based 
(c) Dashboard  development  as  per  user  requirement (integrated  with 
multiple database/data sources) 
(d) Source code and all configuration file will be handed over to IN. 
 
4. Developed  solution  would  be  (able  to)  and  used  for analysing  data  being 
generated from various platforms and sources in an on premise private cloud. Some 
features to be developed are as follows: - 
 
(a) Data Visualization.    Creating  intuitive  and  interactive  visualizations. 
This is crucial for naval operations where complex data sets from sensors (e.g., 
sonar, radar etc.) need to be interpreted quickly and effectively. 
(b) Real-Time Analytics. With sensor data being collected 
continuously, tool  to provide  real-time  analytics  and  dashboards.  This  allows 
naval   operators   to   make   timely   decisions   based   on   the   most   current 
information. 
(c) Integration Capabilities. Integrate    with    various    data    sources, 
including databases, Excel files, and cloud services. This is particularly useful 
for  combining  historical  data  with  real-time  sensor  data  for  comprehensive 
analysis. 
(d) Customizable Reports. Create tailored reports that focus on specific 
metrics    relevant    to    naval    operations, such    as    vessel   performance, 
environmental  conditions,  or  mission  readiness. (to  be  developed  in  dash 
board) 

(e) Enhanced Collaboration. Sharing of insights and reports across teams 
while maintaining control over data access in a private cloud environment. 
(f) Predictive Analytics. Should support advanced analytics, enabling 
predictive modeling to forecast trends or mission outcomes based on historical 
data. 
(g) User-Friendly Interface. The  tool's  ease  of  use  allows  personnel, 
regardless  of  technical  expertise,  to engage with  the  data, facilitating  a  data-
driven culture within the naval organization. 
(h) Scalability. As  data  volume  grows, tool  should scale  accordingly, 
accommodating additional  sensor  data  and  more  complex  analyses  without 
compromising performance. 
5. Further,  it  is  imperative  that  the selected software and design tool shouldn’t 
have any requirement to be connected to internet for any update or feature.
